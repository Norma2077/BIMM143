## PDB statistics

To read the csv file downloaded from PDB, we are going to use the command "`read.csv`"

```{r}
pdb_stats <- read.csv('Data Export Summary.csv',row.names=1)
```

Q1 What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

I need to sum all the elements of the x-ray column

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb_stats$X.ray))
```

```{r}
n_xray <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb_stats$X.ray)))
n_em <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb_stats$EM)))
n_total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb_stats$Total)))
```

```{r}
(n_xray+n_em)/n_total

```

92.99 percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

Q2 What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
total_protein <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb_stats[1,7]))
```

Protein

```{r}
total_protein/n_total
```

86.81 percentage of structures in the PDB are protein.

Q3 Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 5 structures in the current PDB.

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

figure 1

![](1HSG.png)

figure 2( Asp 25)

![](images/1HSG%20(1).png){width="635"}

**Q6**: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

**Q4**: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Because the structure of a water molecule compared to an amino acid structure is too small.

**Q5**: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

The water molecule highlighted in figure 3 is HOH 308.

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
pdb
```

**Q7:** How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

**Q8:** Name one of the two non-protein residues?

nucleic Atoms

**Q9:** How many protein chains are in this structure?

2

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure by NMA

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
```

```{r}
adk

```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m,file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
